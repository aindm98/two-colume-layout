            <p>
                Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball, also known as the ping-pong ball,
                 back and forth across a table using small solid rackets. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net.
                 Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), 
                 founded in 1926. ITTF currently includes 226 member associations.
                 The table tennis official rules are specified in the ITTF handbook. Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988,
                  with several event categories. From 1988 until 2004, these were men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles and women's doubles.
                  Since 2008, a team event has been played instead of the doubles.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p> 
                The sport originated in Victorian England, where it was played among the upper-class as an after-dinner parlour game. It has been suggested that makeshift versions of the game were developed by British military officers in India around the 1860s or 1870s,
                who brought it back with them. A row of books stood up along the center of the table as a net, two more books served as rackets
                and were used to continuously hit a golf-ball.<br/>
                The name "ping-pong" was in wide use before British manufacturer J. Jaques & Son Ltd trademarked it in 1901. The name "ping-pong" then came to describe the game played using the rather
                 expensive Jaques's equipment, with other manufacturers calling it table tennis. A similar situation arose in the United States, where Jaques sold the rights to the "ping-pong" name to Parker Brothers. Parker Brothers then enforced its trademark for the term in the 1920s,
                making the various associations change their names to "table tennis" instead of the more common, but trademarked, term.
                <br/>
                The next major innovation was by James W. Gibb, a British enthusiast of table tennis,
                who discovered novelty celluloid balls on a trip to the US in 1901 and found them to be ideal for the game. This was followed by E.C. Goode who, in 1901, invented the modern version of the racket by fixing a sheet of pimpled, or stippled, rubber to the wooden blade. Table tennis was growing in popularity by 1901 to the extent that tournaments were being organized, books being written on the subject,
                and an unofficial world championship was held in 1902. In those early days, the scoring system was the same as in lawn tennis.
                Although both a "Table Tennis Association" and a "Ping Pong Association" existed by 1910, a new Table Tennis Association
                was founded in 1921, and renamed the English Table Tennis Association in 1926.
                <br/>
                The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) followed in 1926.London hosted the first official World Championships in 1926.
                In 1933, the United States Table Tennis Association, now called USA Table Tennis, was formed.    
                In the 1930s, Edgar Snow commented in Red Star Over China that the Communist forces in the Chinese Civil War
                had a "passion for the English game of table tennis" which he found "bizarre". On the other hand, the popularity of the sport waned in 1930s Soviet Union, partly because of the promotion of team and military sports, and partly because of a theory that the game had adverse health effects.
                In the 1950s, paddles that used a rubber sheet combined with an underlying sponge layer changed the game dramatically,
                introducing greater spin and speed.<br/>
                 These were introduced to Britain by sports goods manufacturer S.W. Hancock Ltd. The use of speed
                  glue beginning in the mid 1980s increased the spin and speed even further, 
                  resulting in changes to the equipment to "slow the game down". 
                  Table tennis was introduced as an Olympic sport at the Olympics in 1988.

            <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <p>
                According to ITTF rule 2.13.1, the first service is decided by lot,
                 normally a coin toss. It is also common for one player (or the umpire/scorer) to hide the ball in one or the other hand, usually hidden under the table, allowing the other player to guess which hand the ball is in. The correct or incorrect guess gives the "winner" the option to choose to serve, receive, or to choose which side of the table to use.
                (A common but non-sanctioned method is for the players to play the ball back and forth three times and then play out the point.
                This is commonly referred to as "serve to play", "rally to serve", "play for serve", or "volley for serve".)
                <br/>
                In game play, the player serving the ball commences a play.
                The server first stands with the ball held on the open palm of the hand not carrying the paddle, 
                called the freehand, and tosses the ball directly upward without spin, at least 16 cm (6.3 in) high.
                The server strikes the ball with the racket on the ball's descent so that it touches first his court and then touches
                directly the receiver's court without touching the net assembly. In casual games, many players do not toss the ball upward; however, 
                this is technically illegal and can give the serving player an unfair advantage.
                <br/>
                he ball must remain behind the endline and above the upper surface of the table, known as the playing surface, at all times during the service. The server cannot use his/her body or clothing to obstruct sight of the ball;
                 the opponent and the umpire must have a clear view of the ball at all times. If the umpire is doubtful of the legality
                  of a service they may first interrupt play and give a warning to the server. 
                If the serve is a clear failure or is doubted again by the umpire after the warning, the receiver scores a point.
                <br/>
                If the service is "good", then the receiver must make a "good" return by hitting the ball back before it bounces a second
                 time on receiver's side of the table so that the ball passes the net and touches the opponent's court, either directly or after 
                 touching the net assembly. Thereafter, the server and receiver must alternately make a return until the rally is over. 
                 Returning the serve is one of the most difficult parts of the game, as the server's first move is 
                often the least predictable and thus most advantageous shot due to the numerous spin and speed choices at his or her disposal.
